# Arduino Uno Basics

The sketches in this project cover some basic concepts for programming the Arduino Uno, such as: blinking an LED, digital inputs and outputs, and analog inputs and outputs.

0) Do Nothing - this sketch resets the board. Useful for "turning off" the currently running sketch since the default is that once a sketch is run, it will keep going forever until the power is cut off to the board.

1) Blink One LED - Blink an LED on/off

2) Digital Outputs - Light up a series of LEDs, one at a time, in round robin fashion

3) Digital Input - Light up a series of LEDs, one at a time, in round robin robin. Press a button to make the LEDs light up in the opposite direction and at a faster speed.

4) Analog Outputs - Lights up a group of LEDs all at once, at different intervals/steps, from dimmest to brightest and back to dim again

5) Analog Output Pulse - Gradually lights up a group of LEDs all at once, from dimmest to brightest and back to dim again

6) Analog Input - Gradually light up each LED, one at a time, as we turn up the knob on the potentiometer, and then gradually dim each LED, one at a time, as we turn down the knob on the potentiometer.
